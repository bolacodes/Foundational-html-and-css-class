        <h1>Who is Victoria?</h1>

        <p>
            Victoria is a 25-year old female who is mostly introverted. She's tall, dark and has beautiful eyes. 
            <br>
            She's the first of her kind. A completely graceful soul. A kind, empathetic being who loves to put people first. She loves God and is
            actively seeking for a stable relationship with Him. 
            <br>
            She loves to love and puts family first. She's mostly a loner who thrives in her solitude. She's quite curious and has a knack for
            learning new things. An education graduate who's trying to pivot into the tech space. She's got basic knowledge of product design and is
            currently taking lessons in software development. 
            <br>
            She hopes to meet a man who'd love her just as she loves him in the nearest future. But in the meantime, she's putting her best foot
            foraward in trying to make a name for herself in the tech world. 
            <br>
            Oh, she's also insanely in love with kitchen gadgets and can spend a fortune on those. Like what you hear about her and want to get to know
            her?
